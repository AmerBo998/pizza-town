       <strong> Two years ago, two friends were chillin' and playing GTA V at home. After some time, they were hungry and wanted something to eat.
        They got into a car and drove to nearest fast-food restaurant and wanted some pizza. Waiter told them that they only serve hamburgers 
        and that "<i>...it is not a 'pizza town'</i>...".Those words gave an idea to the two young men and they started their own restaurant
        called "<b>Pizza Town</b>".

        Today, our brand has <a href='locations.html'>four (4) stores</a> in four big American cities.
         We also offer delivery services so you do not have to leave your home to have delicious pizza.
        All you need to do is to visit our site, make an order, pay on delivery (when you check if everything is OK) and enjoy hot pizza while watching Netflix.

        If you want to see what we offer and (maybe) make an order, you can do it right <a href='menu.html'>here.</a>
